      <h3>Our business originated when me and my partner Youssef, wanted to create a place for people who had a huge passion for stationery, journalling, and everything in between. Recently both of us developed a new passion for bullet journaling and found so many different materials online and in-store, but none of which satisfies our needs, or the needs of people around us locally who seemed to be having the same problem. Some notebooks were too expensive, others were cheap quality or pages constantly kept falling out We wanted people to have a place where they could have their own custom notebooks in which they would decide whatever attributes they wanted with affordable prices and amazing quality. You can choose the amount of paper, the type of paper, the binding of the book and so much more! Not only do we have notebooks but we also have a multitude of utensils such as gel pens, ballpoint pens, highlighters, and even fountain pens which aren’t quite popular in this modern age, but we still wanted to include them for the people who are older and still enjoy using these classic and stylish pens. Our bundles make it even easier and more efficient to start journaling, painting, writing, and even card-making. It’s as simple as a few clicks to start your adventures in creating whatever you desire. And using our products will allow you to spend more time making your creative dreams a reality and less time being frustrated over products that are doing everything but allowing you to run wild with your imagination. So? What are you waiting for? Let’s get started! Click on the Nifty Notebooks, Uplifting Utensils, or the Bountiful Bundles to start looking for the perfect stationery to fuel all of your desires.</h3>
